Q1) Explain why Java is platform independent ?
Answer) Java is platform Independent because it has a compiler in which it compiles all the java
code and APIs into bytecodes. Once it is converted into bytecodes then it becomes effectively 
platform independent. The java virtual machine (JVM) takes care of the difference
between the bytecodes for the different platforms. By this java program can be run on any
operating system irrespective of on which operating system the program is written.
Other programming languages such as C and C++ are not platform-independent.
